# PrusaLink Standalone

## Motivation
 PrusaLink is awesome but it has the printer board capacity limitation, having the rather simple code of the PrusaLinkWeb project embedded into a multiplatform JS browser is a no-brainer and can off-load that strain completely from the printers

## Installation
Either run `npm install` or `yarn`

## Running
`npm run start` or `yarn start`

## Packaging
`npm run make` or `yarn run make`
